PWM stands for Pulse Width Modulation. It is a technique used to control the amount of power given to a digital circuit. This is done by encoding analog signal with digital pulses. It changes the pulse signal's width in electrical systems to regulate the average power supplied to a load. Among the applications that PWM can be useful is controlling brightness of a LED, speed of a motor or regulating the output of audio amplifiers.  
The design consists of basic and simple blocks as counter , timer , comparator and D flip flop to make the output syncrhonized with the system clock.
